This repositoty includes a Digital Twin-oriented hybrid experimentation framework that integrates physical IEEE 802.15.4 nodes with a virtual replica composed of emulated devices. The framework maintains a synchronized loop between real and virtual environments, enabling real-time monitoring, topology reconstruction, trace-driven evaluations, and interactive feedback between the digital and physical domains. 


The figure below illustrates the physical–virtual hybrid setup used in the Digital Twin-oriented experimentation framework. The environment combines a workstation running the virtual replica (including the IEEE 802.15.4 emulation, topology reconstruction modules, and real-time analytics) with multiple laptops connected to the testbed and responsible for orchestrating, monitoring, and injecting trace-driven events. This integrated setup supports the synchronized loop between real and virtual nodes, enabling real-time observation, control, and bidirectional feedback between the physical IoT devices and their digital counterparts.
